{\bf Variable order smoothness priors for ill-posed inverse problems - Calvetti
\& Somersalo -} The authors present a method for solving inverse problems that
is informed by mixtures of variable weighted Gaussian autoregressive (AR)
priors.  Both the parameter determining the mixture (via convex combinations of
different AR models) and the parameter for weighting each observation (termed
innovation in time series literature) are allowed to vary over the domain.  Their algorithm
presents estimates of the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator and does \emph{not} quantify
uncertainty in these estimates.  They implement the method on a deblurring example 
that is problematic for a standard fixed level AR prior, but is ideal for the structure
of their algorithm.

A few hyper-prior distribution families are presented for both the mixture
parameter, $\theta_i$, and the innovation variance, $\gamma_i$.  Two
hyper-prior families are presented for $\theta_i$.  The first assumes that over
most of the domain the solution will have one a particular AR model level
smoothness.  The other, which is implemented in a computed example, assumes a
smooth transition in the values of $\theta_j$.  The hyper-priors given for
$\gamma_i$ are distributed with a generalized $\Gamma$ distribution.

The posterior distribution depends on $(x,\theta_j,\gamma_j)$, and the algorithm for approximating the MAP estimate maximizes in succession
